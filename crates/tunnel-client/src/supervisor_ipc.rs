//! Local, read-only supervisor status IPC (task row M6-06).
//!
//! `tunnel-client connect` is the supervisor. It listens on one Unix socket
//! per profile and answers two requests. `status` returns a redacted
//! snapshot; `tunnel-client status` and `tunnel-client doctor` read it.
//! `disconnect` (task row M0-03, coordinator decision 2026-09-28) delivers
//! one stop request to the supervisor, which then takes **the same orderly
//! stop path SIGTERM takes**, with the same bounds; it is answered with the
//! snapshot as it stood. That is the only request that changes anything, and
//! it grants nothing new: the socket sits in the owner-only (`0700`)
//! credential directory and admits only this UID, so anyone who can reach
//! it can already read the client's private key. `credentials renew` remains
//! unimplemented.
//!
//! **Authorization is the same user, checked three ways.** The socket is
//! created in a directory that must be owned by this user and writable by no
//! one else, and is set to `0600`; the server compares every accepted peer's
//! kernel-reported UID (`SO_PEERCRED` / `getpeereid`, through
//! `tokio::net::UnixStream::peer_cred`) with its own effective UID and closes
//! any other peer without a byte; and the reader refuses a socket that is not
//! owned by it, is readable or writable by anyone else, or whose listening
//! peer is another UID -- so a planted socket cannot impersonate the
//! supervisor either. No unsafe code: the UID comes from `rustix`'s safe
//! `geteuid`, and the peer credential from `tokio`.
//!
//! **The endpoint** is `[supervisor] ipc_path` when set, else
//! `supervisor.sock` beside the client key. That is the recommendation task
//! row M0-03 recorded (options (c) with (a)), applied by default pending owner
//! confirmation (2026-09-25).
//!
//! **The profile lock is an exclusive `flock` on `supervisor.lock`** (the
//! socket path with its extension replaced by `lock`), opened `O_NOFOLLOW`,
//! mode `0600`, owned by this user, and held for the supervisor's whole life
//! ([`ProfileLock`]). The kernel releases it when the process ends, however
//! it ends, so a SIGKILLed supervisor never leaves a stale lock. Probing,
//! unlinking and binding the socket happen only while it is held, so two
//! supervisors starting together cannot both decide a socket is stale and
//! both bind (task row M6-C132, the M6-06 review). A second supervisor meets
//! the lock and exits `9` `SUPERVISOR_RUNNING`; one that cannot take the lock
//! for any other reason refuses to start too (fail closed). A socket file
//! nobody listens on is a stale leftover of a killed supervisor and is
//! replaced; one a live listener answers (a supervisor from before the lock)
//! is `SUPERVISOR_RUNNING` as well.
//!
//! **Redaction is by construction.** [`SupervisorStatus`] holds identifiers,
//! phases, counters, deadlines, a certificate expiry and export names and
//! kinds. It has no field that can hold a path, an endpoint, certificate or
//! key material, a ticket, a token, a canary or payload bytes, and its error
//! field is a closed diagnostic code rather than a message.
