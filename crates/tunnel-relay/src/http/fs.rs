//! The filesystem capability descriptor, the WSS upgrade, and the byte pump —
//! implementation gate 4 of `docs/filesystem-api.md`, relay side.
//!
//! One URL, three answers, exactly as the contract's table says:
//!
//! | Request | Answer |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | Authenticated `GET`, no `Upgrade` | the JSON descriptor, `no-store` |
//! | Authenticated WSS upgrade, subprotocol `agent-tunnel.9p.v1` | a binary 9P connection |
//! | Anything else | `405`; there is no JSON per-operation RPC here |
//!
//! # The error body is the contract's, not the relay's
//!
//! Every other relay route answers the flat `{code, execution, message}` body.
//! The filesystem endpoint answers `{"error": {"code", "message", "requestId"}}`
//! with the contract's own code vocabulary — `UNAUTHENTICATED`,
//! `EXPORT_NOT_FOUND`, `ACCESS_DENIED`, `CAPABILITIES_CHANGED`,
//! `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, `DEVICE_OFFLINE`, `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE` — because
//! `docs/filesystem-api.md` specifies that shape for this URL and says it takes
//! precedence over earlier sketches. **This is a decision, not an oversight:**
//! the alternative was to amend the contract to the relay's existing shape, and
//! a published client contract that already names its codes is the worse of the
//! two things to change. The two vocabularies do not mix: a filesystem response
//! never carries `execution`, and no other route carries `error`.
//!
//! # What crosses the tunnel
//!
//! The consumer WebSocket's rule is **one complete 9P message per binary
//! message**, and this relay enforces it with gate 3's own `decode_exact`
//! before a byte is forwarded. The device's rule is an ordered byte stream, and
//! it reassembles with gate 3's `FrameDecoder`. Both of gate 3's two decode
//! entry points are therefore exercised on the real path, which is what they
//! were made two functions for.
//!
//! The device→consumer direction carries `tunnel_fs_provider::record` framing
//! rather than raw 9P, for one reason: a session ends with a **close code**
//! decided on the device, and no 9P message means "close with 1008". See that
//! module for why the alternative — inventing an opcode — is worse.
//!
//! # Owner-local only, and said so
//!
//! Gate 4 admits a filesystem session **only at the relay that owns the
//! device**. A consumer reaching a non-owner relay is answered `503
//! BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE` with `DEVICE_NOT_OWNED_HERE` in the message, rather
//! than being forwarded over the peer hop the way `http-forward/1` is. The hop
//! itself is not the difficulty — the peer envelope already carries a
//! `required_scope` and would take this one unchanged — but proving a bounded,
//! credited 9P stream across it is its own piece of evidence, and claiming it
//! from an untested path would be worse than naming it. It is recorded as
//! gate-4 residue.

    // because the export's backend is the thing that went away", while 1011
    // "would report it as an unexpected relay failure" when the relay is
    // healthy and the device is not.
    //
