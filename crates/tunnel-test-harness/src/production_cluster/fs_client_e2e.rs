//! Implementation gate 6 of `docs/filesystem-api.md` over the real cluster:
//! the **actual `@agent-tunnel/client`**, run by `node`, against the production
//! relay's real descriptor endpoint and WSS upgrade, a real Redis catalog, a
//! real grant and a real device connector serving filesystem exports.
//!
//! Gates 4 and 5 drove the endpoint with a 9P client written in this crate.
//! That proves the endpoint and proves nothing about the published package,
//! which is what gate 6 says in terms it must prove: "compilation against a
//! source interface or a fake in-memory adapter is insufficient to claim remote
//! compatibility". Every socket in `packages/client`'s own tests is a loopback
//! socket to a harness that speaks the wire and is not the product. This gate
//! is the sentence that residue asked for.
//!
//! **How node is driven, and why a child process.** The client is TypeScript;
//! the cluster is Rust. The alternatives were to embed a JavaScript runtime in
//! the harness or to re-implement the client's behaviour here, and both give up
//! the only thing worth proving — that *the package* interoperates. So the
//! harness spawns `node` on `packages/client/e2e/gate.ts`, which imports that
//! package's own `src/` and reports newline-delimited JSON on stdout. Three
//! channels, each for what it carries:
//!
//! * a **plan file** named in argv, carrying the endpoints, one consumer token
//!   and the shape of the synthetic content — a file rather than an argument
//!   vector, so a token never appears in a process listing;
//! * **stdout**, one JSON object per line, ending in exactly one `report`;
//! * **stdin**, carrying `go` lines, which is how the two rendezvous below are
//!   made races the harness wins rather than sleeps.
//!
//! Every judgement is taken here, by [`validate_fs_client_e2e_evidence`],
//! against evidence that is scalars, counts and closed labels. A driver that
//! decided for itself what passing meant could not smuggle a verdict past it.
//!
//! What one run proves, in the order [`exercise`] takes it:
//!
//! * **TLS is real.** `node` verifies the relay's certificate against the
//!   fixture CA through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`; `allowInsecureLoopback` is never
//!   passed, so an unverifiable chain is `INSECURE_ENDPOINT` and not a session.
//! * **The descriptor**, fetched by the client and validated by its own schema
//!   rules, naming the subprotocol, the dialect and an opaque grant revision.
//! * **The `grantRevision` header matters.** The client reads a descriptor, the
//!   harness moves the grant in the authoritative catalog, and the upgrade
//!   carrying the revision the client read is refused `409
//!   CAPABILITIES_CHANGED`. That is the only way to observe from outside that
//!   the header was sent at all.
//! * **An unauthenticated descriptor read** is `UNAUTHENTICATED`.
//! * **An outcome the client classifies `unknown`**, with the device's own
//!   ledger read beside it. This is gate 5's own residue: "there is no wire
//!   field for an outcome", so a dispatched mutation with no reply is `unknown`
//!   on this side and the device's counters are the only place the truth lives.
//! * **The authenticated upgrade**, its selected subprotocol and negotiated
//!   `msize`, a checksummed read spanning many `Rread` messages, a checksummed
//!   write spanning many `Twrite` messages verified on the host, and a
//!   directory listing with every name exactly once.
//! * **A read-only grant refusing mutations at both layers**: locally, because
//!   the descriptor does not advertise them, and on the device, through the raw
//!   session a custom 9P client would use — with the export unchanged after.
//! * **One adapter**, not only the raw client, driven end to end over the same
//!   sockets.
//!
//! Every byte of fixture content is synthetic and generated here; no evidence
//! field, log line or error message carries a path, a name or file content.
