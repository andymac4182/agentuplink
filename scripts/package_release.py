# the download had no guide.  It now carries `docs/operator.md` and every
# local document the guide links, at the same relative paths, so the guide's
# links resolve inside the unpacked archive exactly as they do in the
# repository.  **The set is derived from the guide's own links**, not listed
# here: a link added to the guide ships its target with no second edit.
#
# The linked documents link further documents, and shipping that closure
# would ship the whole repository (it reaches 56 files, `docs/tasks.md`
# included).  So in the *shipped copies* only, a relative link to a file the
# archive does not carry is rewritten to that file at the archive's own
# source commit on GitHub -- the same commit `release.json` or
# `PROVENANCE.txt` names -- so every link in the archive either resolves
# inside it or names the exact source it was built from.  The guide itself is
# never rewritten: every local link it has must ship, and `release_documents`
# refuses a guide with a local link that cannot.  So the guide in the archive
# is byte-identical to the repository's, which is what lets
# `scripts/m6-release-artifact.py verify --check docs` execute the shipped
# copy.
