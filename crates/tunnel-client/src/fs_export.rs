//! The device half of implementation gate 4: serving 9P2000.L over one logical
//! tunnel stream.
//!
//! The connector actor stays the only owner of each stream's sequence, credit
//! and authorization state, exactly as it is for `http-forward/1`. This module
//! only turns the ordered bytes of one stream into 9P frames, hands them to
//! [`tunnel_fs_provider::Provider`], and writes the provider's answers back.
//!
//! # Where each rule is enforced
//!
//! * **Framing.** The device's transport rule is an ordered byte stream, so
//!   inbound bytes go through gate 3's [`FrameDecoder`], which may split one
//!   message across tunnel DATA frames and pack several into one. The relay
//!   enforces the *other* rule — one complete 9P message per consumer binary
//!   message — with gate 3's `decode_exact`. Conflating the two is the bug
//!   `docs/testing.md` warns about, which is why they are two functions.
//! * **Authorization.** The connector confirms each stream's authorization
//!   against the owner within the five-second ceiling of `docs/cluster.md`, and
//!   [`StreamAuthority`] is the window through which the provider reads it
//!   after every queue wait. The provider never caches it.
//! * **Capabilities.** The four capabilities arrive in the OPEN's bounded
//!   `fs_capabilities` metadata and are **intersected** with the device's own
//!   local allowlist, so a relay cannot widen what the operator configured.
//!   That is the connector's independent local enforcement, not a duplicate of
//!   the relay's check.
//!
//! # Blocking
//!
//! [`tunnel_fs_provider::Provider::step`] performs the host call inline, on the
//! exchange task. Every call it makes is one bounded `openat`, `statat`,
//! `pread`, `pwrite` or `getdents` against a local filesystem, so the stall is
//! short — but it is a stall, and on a network or FUSE filesystem it would not
//! be short. Gate 4 expected gate 5 to move the step onto a blocking pool;
//! **gate 5 did not**, so the call is still inline and a `pwrite` is now among
//! the ones it makes. It stays residue rather than a claim, and
//! `docs/filesystem-api.md` records that the prediction did not come true.
