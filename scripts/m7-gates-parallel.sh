# Parallel survey runner.
#
# The serial runner spends ~21 minutes on 73 gates that are mostly waiting on
# sockets and Redis, not burning CPU. Gates use isolated Redis namespaces and
# ephemeral ports, so most can run concurrently.
#
# Timing-sensitive gates are deliberately NOT run concurrently: this session
# has measured load-induced false failures on exactly those (credential expiry,
# recovery attempts, GOAWAY rotation, peer capacity, timing boundaries), and a
# false failure costs far more investigation time than the minutes saved.
# They run serially after the parallel pass.
#
# Measured on 2026-09-14 against the 73-gate suite: 897 s wall and 73/73 passing,
# against a 1248 s serial baseline. The parallel lane finished its 63 gates in
# about 332 s (896 s of work at 3 jobs); the 10 serial gates are 565 s of that
# total, so the serial tail now dominates. Overlapping the two lanes would reach
# roughly 10 minutes but would put parallel load underneath the timing-sensitive
# gates, which is the exact thing this split exists to avoid.
#
# Usage: m7-gates-parallel.sh <label> [jobs]
#
# Every run writes into its own new directory, gates-<label>-<UTC>-<pid>, and
# stamps it with run.txt (nonce, label, head).  It used to write into
# gates-<label> and truncate that directory's summary.tsv, so two agents
# sharing one scratchpad and choosing the same label -- `final`, `check` --
# overwrote each other's logs, and a gate log left by an earlier run read like
# this run's.  A result is attributable only if it names the run that wrote it
# (docs/tasks.md M6-C16).  `M7_GATES_LIST_ONLY=1` stops after the gate lists,
# which is what scripts/test_scratch_log_names.py uses.

# Gates whose assertions are bounded by real deadlines; these run alone.
#
# The tunnel-catalog Redis integration tests are here for a measured reason.
# They assert against the catalog's own two-second Redis operation bound, which
# is a product constant, so running them beside the parallel lane measures how
# busy the machine is rather than the property under test.  Under six competing
# CPU hogs they fail four times out of four with `Database(timed out)` during
# fixture setup, and they pass every standalone run.  The product bound is not
# the thing to relax, so the schedule is.
