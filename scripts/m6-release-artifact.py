"""M6-01 release artifact: assemble one bundle, then check it as a stranger would.

Scope, stated before anything else
----------------------------------
This script produces and checks a release bundle for **one** target triple --
the one it is run on.  It makes no claim about any other OS or architecture.
`docs/testing.md`'s release-artifact gate asks for "every advertised
OS/architecture".  **"Advertised" now resolves to exactly one place**:
`[workspace.metadata.release] advertised-targets` in the root `Cargo.toml`,
declared by the owner.  This file contains no copy of that set -- it reads it,
and the `targets` check requires the manifest, `cargo metadata` and the set a
bundle froze into its `PROVENANCE.txt` to agree.  A bundle this script produces
is still evidence for its own `target` field and for nothing else, and
`targets` says so by naming, in every green run, the declared triples the
bundle does **not** cover.  Which of those triples this host can link and
execute, and by what route, is docs/tasks.md row M6-C13.

What the gate is actually for
-----------------------------
The point of a release artifact check is that the artifact works on a machine
that is **not the build machine**.  Every check here therefore runs against the
*unpacked bundle*, never against `target/` and never through `cargo run`:

  `checksums`   Every file in the bundle hashes to what `SHA256SUMS` records,
                and every file present is listed.  A digest proves the bytes.
  `provenance`  What *produced* the bytes: commit, tracked-diff and
                worktree-status digests, toolchain, build command, and the
                source-copy digest, cross-checked against the
                `scripts/m7-local-source-parity-build.sh` receipt.  A recorded
                hash proves the bytes; it does not prove what produced them,
                so the two are separate checks and the second is the harder
                one.
  `notices`     Third-party licence notices, **generated** from the bundled
                `Cargo.lock` rather than hand-written, and re-derived at check
                time from that same lockfile.  A hand-written NOTICE goes
                stale silently; a generated one that is re-derived cannot.
  `assets`      The required runtime assets are in the bundle and work,
                including `docs/operator.md` and the documents it links, with
                every relative link in them naming a file in the bundle
                (M6-C50).  `tunnel-deadman` is the sharp case: `resolve_sentinel` looks
                for it *beside the running executable*, and its absence is a
                `degraded` doctor result and a one-line warning -- not an
                error.  A bundle that omits it ships a client whose process
                containment is off, announced only by a one-line warning the
                first time an export arms a sentinel.  The check replays that
                resolution rule and then **executes** the result, which is the
                step the product deliberately does not take.  Since M6-C08 the
                product requires a regular file with an execute bit, so it now
                rejects a zero-byte decoy too; what it still cannot do is tell
                an executable *script* of the right name from the sentinel,
                because that needs running the file and `doctor` promises to
                start nothing.  Executing it here is affordable and is the
                whole point of checking at assembly time.
  `cli`         `--help`, `--version`, both `check-config` forms and
                `check-serve-config` on every bundled `*-relay.toml`,
                executed from the unpacked bundle and asserting **content**,
                not exit status.  An exit code of 0 from a binary that
                printed nothing would pass an exit-status check.  The serving
                dry run is separate because legacy `check-config` parses a
                different type and cannot validate a serving document -- CI's
                own comment records that an example failing relay startup
                would otherwise ship green -- and it carries its own witness
                so a control corrupting a client example cannot credit it.
  `targets`     Which advertised set this bundle is one member of, read from
                the owner's declaration rather than from anything in this
                file, and cross-read by `cargo metadata` so a fault in this
                script's parser cannot hide.  A green result always names the
                declared targets this bundle does not cover, because "the
                bundle is sound" and "the set is covered" are different claims
                and conflating them is what M6-01 could not do for want of a
                declared set.
  `portability` Every bundled executable's dynamic dependencies resolve to
                system paths.  An artifact that links back to a path inside
                the build tree works only beside `target/`, which is exactly
                the failure this gate exists to catch, and it is invisible to
                every other check here because the binary runs fine *here*.
  `docs-redis`  Not in the default set: docs/operator.md's Redis-writing
                shape-only commands, `serve` and `connect`, executed against
                this bundle and a disposable Redis given with `--redis-url`
                (M6-C33); DID NOT RUN without one.
  `docs`        docs/operator.md, executed.  Every `console` block runs, as
                one shell session, against this bundle's archive and binaries
                and must print what the guide shows; every `sh shape-only`
                command -- only `serve`, `connect`, `recovery-observe` and
                `recover` may be -- must be accepted by the real binary's
                argument parser; a fence with any other tag than those two
                or a named prose tag is a failure; and each section's counts
                of commands, assertions and shape-only commands are pinned.
                Given an archive, the guide's first step checks that archive
                and its own sidecar.  It also holds
                docs/runtime.md's client exit-code table to the `Cause`
                mapping in the client source.  **The guide and runtime.md it
                executes and compares are the copies the bundle ships**
                (docs/tasks.md M6-C50), so a bundle without a guide is red;
                the client source still comes from the checkout, so unlike the
                checks above it needs a repository beside the bundle (M6-02).

Why every check carries a control
---------------------------------
docs/tasks.md row M5-C11 holds this repository's running list of checks whose
success and whose non-execution looked identical.  The cheap tell it records
is a message stating something the code did not measure, sitting beside a
printed number that contradicted it -- `0 rejection records`, a hard-coded
`361`, `1 skipped`.  The number was there every time; the missing thing was an
assertion on it.

So each check below declares controls that **defeat its mechanism** and
require it to go red, and each control names the witness it expects: the
control asserts not merely that the check failed but that it failed *for the
reason the control planted*.  A control that goes red for an unrelated reason
is reported as a wrong witness and fails `--self-test`, in the shape
`scripts/m0-guard-exit-codes.py` established.

A green run prints the sizes it measured -- files checked, crates notified,
binaries inspected -- so a green result also reports that it ran.

`--self-test` never writes to the repository.  Controls copy the bundle into a
`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` and mutate the copy.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/m6-release-artifact.py notices --out NOTICE
    python3 scripts/m6-release-artifact.py bundle --receipt R --out DIR
    python3 scripts/m6-release-artifact.py verify --bundle DIR
    python3 scripts/m6-release-artifact.py verify --bundle DIR.tar.gz
    python3 scripts/m6-release-artifact.py --self-test --bundle DIR
    python3 scripts/m6-release-artifact.py verify --bundle DIR --check notices

`bundle` writes both a directory and a `.tar.gz` beside it with its own
digest.  `verify` takes either; given the archive it extracts it into a
temporary directory and checks that, which is the gate's "unpack into clean
temporary environments" step actually performed.  `--self-test` takes the
directory, because its controls mutate a copy.

Exit codes: 0 all selected checks passed; 1 at least one failed; 2 the script
could not run a selected check at all.  **2 is not a pass.**  A check that
could not run is reported as DID NOT RUN with the reason, never folded into
the green.

    # `process_containment` before it even attempted to load the
    # configuration and then discarded the whole result whenever any error
    # was present, so a bundle nobody had provisioned gave exit 3,
    # `CREDENTIAL_MISSING`, and `result: null`.  A check written against
    # doctor would have been red for every bundle regardless of whether the
    # sentinel was there -- the mirror image of a check that is green
    # regardless.  **That is fixed (M6-C07): `DoctorOutput::result` is no
    # longer an `Option` and the checks are reported on every path.**
    #
    # This check still does not ask doctor, and the reason has narrowed twice.
    # It is no longer that doctor reports `SENTINEL_PRESENT` for a zero-byte
    # decoy: **M6-C08 fixed that**, and `resolve_sentinel` now requires a
    # regular file with an execute bit, reporting anything else as
    # `PROCESS_CONTAINMENT_SENTINEL_UNUSABLE`.  So the product would now
    # reject the same zero-byte decoy this check rejects.
    #
    # What remains is the reason that was always the real one.  The product's
    # rule is a **mode** check and stops there deliberately -- doctor promises
    # to read a path and start nothing, and the resolution path runs before
    # every supervised child -- so it cannot tell an executable script named
    # `tunnel-deadman` from the sentinel.  This check can, because assembly
    # time is where a process launch is affordable.  Asking doctor would
    # therefore still be asking a question this check answers more strongly.
    #
    # So this replays `tunnel_deadman::resolve_sentinel`'s no-explicit-path
    # branch -- `SENTINEL_BIN` beside the running executable -- and then does
    # the thing the product deliberately does **not** do: it runs it.
    # Executing it is what tells an executable file of the right name from a

# does everything that reads that set still agree about it?**
#
# Three readers of one declaration, compared against each other:
#
#   (1) this script's `tomllib` parse of `[workspace.metadata.release]`;
#   (2) `cargo metadata`'s view of the same table -- a reader this script did
#       not write, so a fault in (1) cannot hide behind it;
#   (3) the set the bundler froze into `PROVENANCE.txt` at build time.
#
# (3) is what makes a *divergence over time* visible rather than only a
# divergence right now: a bundle assembled against a three-triple set and
# checked after someone edited the manifest to two reddens, naming both sets.
# That is the control asked for by "fails if the declared set and whatever the
# tooling actually uses ever diverge".
#
# The check deliberately does **not** pass merely because the bundle's own
# triple is declared.  It always reports the declared targets this bundle does
# not cover, so a green `targets` can never be read as the set being covered.

# The operator guide, executed.  docs/tasks.md row M6-02.
#
# `docs/operator.md` is the document an outside tester follows, and this
# repository has repeatedly caught prose describing things the code does not
# do.  So the guide is not trusted to be right; it is **run**.  Every fence in
# it must carry one of the two tags below or a prose tag named in
# `DOCS_PROSE_FENCES`; any other tag, including none, is a failure rather than
# something skipped (the first version skipped them -- see `classify_doc`):
#
#   ```console        A transcript.  Lines starting `$ ` are commands (a
#                     trailing `\` continues one); every other non-blank line
#                     is output the command must print, matched in order as a
#                     substring, with `...` eliding the text between two
#                     fragments of one line.  All `console` blocks in the file
#                     are **one shell session**, in document order, started in
#                     an empty directory holding the release archive and with
#                     PATH narrowed to the system directories -- so `cd` and
#                     `export PATH=...` in one block carry into the next exactly
#                     as they would in the operator's terminal, and the guide's
#                     own `export PATH` is what puts the bundled binaries on
#                     it.  A command exiting non-zero ends the session red; a
#                     documented non-zero exit is written `...; echo "exit=$?"`
#                     with `exit=N` as its expected output, so the status is
#                     asserted as content.  A command invoking a `tunnel-*`
#                     binary must assert at least one output line: a binary
#                     that exits 0 printing nothing must not pass.
#
#   ```sh shape-only  Commands that need a live, provisioned deployment --
#                     `serve`, `connect` to a real relay, the Redis recovery
#                     commands.  They cannot be run here, and saying so is the
#                     point of the marker.  What *is* checked is that the real
#                     binary accepts the documented argument vocabulary: each
#                     command is run with its `--config` value replaced by a
#                     path that does not exist, and must fail **reading that
#                     file** (`os error 2`) rather than printing its usage.
#                     A renamed subcommand or flag therefore goes red; the
#                     command's runtime behaviour is NOT checked, and the
#                     summary counts these separately so nobody reads them as
#                     executed.
#
# Why a docs check that runs blocks rather than a curated command list: the
# existing `cli` check already holds a curated list (`CLI_PROBES`), and a list
# kept beside the prose is a second copy of it -- the defect docs/tasks.md
# M5-C11 catalogues.  Extracting from the guide itself means the thing
# executed is the thing a tester reads.  It reuses this file's `Result`,
# `stranger_env` and `cargo_is_unreachable`, and runs against the unpacked
# bundle like every other check here.
#
# **The client exit-code table in docs/runtime.md is checked against the code
# too.**  That table said of itself "nothing checks it against the code"; this
# parses `Cause::code` and `Cause::exit_code` out of
# `crates/tunnel-client/src/main.rs` and requires every cause to sit in exactly
# one table row whose status is the one the source selects.  A parse that
# finds too few arms is a red, never a vacuous agreement.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# docs-redis: the guide's Redis-writing commands, executed (task row M6-C33)
#
# `docs` runs as a stranger with no Redis, so the commands that write the
# Redis authority -- section 2.3's `activate-first-incarnation` and
# `provision-catalog`, section 2.5's day-2 commands -- and `serve` and
# `connect` are only argument-checked there.  `docs-redis` executes them,
# **against this bundle's binaries**, with a disposable Redis the maintainer
# supplies (`--redis-url redis://HOST:PORT[/DB]`, plaintext; the check puts
# its own TLS forwarder in front, because `serve` accepts only `rediss://`).
#
# How, and what stands in for the outside world:
#
# * It first runs the whole `console` session exactly as `docs` does, then
#   continues **in the directory the session left**: the rehearsal's device
#   key, its certificate (signed by the rehearsal's throwaway CA), the client
#   profile with that CA imported as its relay CA, and the records documents
#   of sections 2.3 and 2.5 are the ones the guide's own commands produced.
# * The relay's listener certificate is issued here by that same rehearsal
#   CA (the guide says the rehearsal uses one CA for both), and the identity
#   issuer is an RSA key from `openssl genpkey`, whose token this check signs
#   with `openssl dgst`.  The relay configuration is the bundle's
#   `examples/m1-relay.toml` with its placeholders filled in and its
#   `boot_id` line deleted, as section 3.1 says to.
# * Each `sh shape-only` command that writes Redis or serves is taken **from
#   the guide**, in document order, and run with its `/etc/agent-tunnel/...`
#   paths mapped to those files.  A path the map does not know is a red,
#   not a skip.  What each must print is the text the guide's prose names.
# * Before `provision-catalog`, the guide's own `serve` command must refuse
#   the activated namespace with `class=unprovisioned` (section 2.3, M6-C34).
# * After the writes, `serve` must reach `tunnel-relay listening`, `connect`
#   must serve one echo through it (the export's canary followed by the bytes
#   sent), the same request under an unprovisioned subject must be refused,
#   and both must stop on SIGTERM as section 3.1 says.
#
# `recovery-observe`, `recover` and `rebind-redis-run` stay unexecuted (they
# need a recovery approval or a Redis restart) and are counted as such.
# Without `--redis-url` the check reports DID NOT RUN, never a pass.  Every
# key it wrote is deleted, also on failure.

# invokes no check at all: it exercises a pure function's rule in both
# directions.  Both are worth running; only the first is evidence that a check

# The triples written below are the only triples in this file outside the
# declaration's own reader.  **Most, not all, are values the check must
# reject**: `NOT_A_REAL_TRIPLE` and `UNDECLARED_TRIPLE` are, but the probes
# below also use `aarch64-apple-darwin` as an *accepted* value -- in the
# duplicate and bare-string parser cases, and as one of the two sets the
# cargo-reader probe declares in its throwaway workspace.  The earlier
# wording here said every one of them was a rejected value, which was simply
# not true of three of them.
#
# What matters is the weaker and actually-true property: **none of them is a
# second copy of the advertised set**, and nothing outside this controls
# section reads any of them.  The check and the reader resolve the manifest.
