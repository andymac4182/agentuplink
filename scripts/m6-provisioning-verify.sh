# Task row M6-C21: operator provisioning of one relay and one device, proved
# with shipped binaries against a real Redis.
#
#   TEST_REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:63790/ scripts/m6-provisioning-verify.sh
#
# 1. Builds `tunnel-relay` and `tunnel-client` into the caller's target
#    directory, so the end-to-end gate never runs a stale client.
# 2. Runs the catalog-level tests of first activation and provisioning
#    (`crates/tunnel-catalog/tests/redis_provisioning.rs`), and the Redis
#    connection stage tests (`redis_connection_stage.rs`, task row M6-C72).
# 3. Runs the end-to-end gate (`crates/tunnel-relay/tests/m6_provisioning_process.rs`):
#    empty namespace -> `activate-first-incarnation` -> a `serve` that must
#    refuse the unprovisioned namespace with `class=unprovisioned` and write
#    nothing (M6-C34) -> `provision-catalog` ->
#    `serve` + `connect` -> one echo through the tunnel, then two identity
#    refusals (task row M6-C32) that must reach the device as a terminal
#    CREDENTIAL_ERROR, exit 3, and a not-yet-valid credential that must stay
#    a retryable TRANSPORT_ERROR, exit 4.  Before activating, it also runs
#    `activate-first-incarnation` against a wrong Redis CA, a wrong password,
#    an ACL user without INFO and a Redis that requires a client certificate,
#    and requires each to print its own stage and class (M6-C72).
# 4. Runs task row M7-C92's gate in the same binary: 300 sequential unary
#    echoes (more than twice the connector's 128-entry OPEN retention) and
#    two data rotations in one device session, every one answered 200, and
#    task row M7-C93's gate: echoes paced across two rotations, capped below
#    the retention so it can only be red for the rotation defect.
# 5. Runs task row M6-C57's gates in the same binary: an MCP, an ACP and a
#    filesystem service, each provisioned from its shipped records example
#    (examples/m6-catalog-{mcp,acp,fs}.toml) with the shipped commands and
#    served by `connect` with the export that example documents, backed by
#    the repository's MCP and ACP fixture binaries and a temporary directory.
#    Each must answer one real consumer request from the device-side backend:
#    MCP `initialize` and a `tools/call`, ACP `initialize`, and a 9P read of
#    a synthetic file.
# 6. Runs task row M6-C31's gate in the same binary: with `serve` running and
#    never restarted, `add-user`, `add-device` (a new key and a certificate
#    from the test's synthetic device CA), `add-service` and `set-grant` add a
#    second user and device; the second device connects and serves the
#    second user an echo; the first request after `set-grant` is served and
#    the first after `revoke-grant` refused; `revoke-device` closes the live
#    session (`AUTHORIZATION_REVOKED`) and the device exits 3.  Its catalog
#    test (M6-C31, in step 2) proves each addition refuses an unprovisioned
#    namespace, a stale incarnation and every duplicate, and leaves the
#    incarnation, run and reservation keys unchanged.
#    M6-C233 additionally rehearses replacement-device re-enrolment: real
#    120-second OLD certificate, two migrated grants, live old revocation,
#    a restarted NEW client and relay, and service past OLD's real expiry.
#    This is single-relay coverage; same-device renewal remains deferred.
#
# 7. Runs task row M6-C65's catalog test in step 2: the `unbound` and
#    `run_changed` classes of `serve`'s fence, `rebind-redis-run`'s catalog
#    call with each refusal, and a single relay's continuity token.  The
#    M6-C65 process gate restarts a Redis, so it is not run here (it never
#    touches `TEST_REDIS_URL`); `scripts/m6-redis-restart-verify.sh` runs it
#    against its own Redis container, and this step skips it by name, as it
#    skips M6-C67's readiness gate (`m6c67_`), which does the same.
#    The ACP demo (`m8_acp_demo_`) shares this binary and is skipped too: it
#    needs the pinned client built with `--features interop`, and
#    scripts/demo-acp.sh runs it.
#
# Every Redis test these steps run is `#[ignore]`d in the ordinary workspace
# run because it needs Redis: the 8 catalog provisioning tests (M6-C63's
# `last_seen_at` and M6-C35's two atomic-provisioning tests among them), the 3 Redis
# connection stage tests, and the 8 end-to-end tests (M6-C21, M7-C92, M7-C93,
# the three M6-C57 service gates, M6-C31 and M6-C24's private metrics
# listener, `m6c24-metrics`).  A filtered or skipped test
# would print `0 passed` and exit 0, so this script requires each run's own
# pass count and each gate's own `ok` line (`m6c21-e2e`, `m7c92-echo`,
# `m7c93-rotation`, `m6c57-mcp`, `m6c57-acp`, `m6c57-fs`, each M6-C57 line
# with the refused stranger's exact `stranger_status=401`, the MCP line with
# M6-C58's `stock_client_headers=200 unlisted_header_named=400` (a stock
# client's `User-Agent` and `Accept-Encoding` are dropped at the ingress, and
# any other unlisted header is refused by name), `m6c31-catalog`
# with its measured fields), and exits 1 when any is missing: green here
# means the tests ran.
