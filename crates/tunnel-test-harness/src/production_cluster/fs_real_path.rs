//! Implementation gate 4 of `docs/filesystem-api.md` over the real cluster:
//! a consumer HTTPS descriptor read and a real WSS 9P2000.L session through
//! the owning relay's public route, the owner actor, the device data
//! WebSocket and `tunnel-client`'s filesystem export, against six filesystem
//! exports seeded side by side on one device.
//!
//! What one run proves, in the order [`run`] takes it:
//!
//! * The descriptor a grant produces, and that it carries no host path and no
//!   host identity field.
//! * The HTTP refusal matrix before any upgrade: `403` for an empty grant and
//!   for an unsupported host, `401`, `404`, `405`, `409` and `426`.
//! * A real upgrade: the server selects `agent-tunnel.9p.v1`, `Tversion`
//!   negotiates `9P2000.L` and an `msize`, and `Tattach` binds a directory.
//! * A forged `Tattach` — a non-empty `uname`, and separately a non-`NOFID`
//!   `afid` — is not admitted and closes the socket with `1002`.
//! * A checksummed read spanning many `Rread` messages, and a `Treaddir`
//!   paged by opaque cookie over more than four pages with every name once.
//! * The capability matrix: `list` without `read` and `read` without `list`,
//!   each on its own export.
//! * A pipelined `Tflush`, a fid-generation collision, a non-owner relay's
//!   refusal, and every mutation refused with the host file unchanged.
//! * A **real** grant revision advanced in the catalog between discovery and
//!   upgrade: the superseded revision is refused at both the descriptor and
//!   the upgrade, and the current one is admitted.
//! * A **real** revocation under a live 9P session on its own export: the
//!   session closes, nothing further is answered, and the close code is
//!   recorded.
//!
//! Every byte of fixture content is synthetic and generated here; no evidence
//! field, log line or error message carries a path, a name or file content.
