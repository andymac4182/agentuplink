"""Delete one filesystem guard at a time, run the tests it should protect, and
restore it.

This is the red-then-green evidence behind the filesystem implementation gates
of `docs/filesystem-api.md`.  Two suites live here:

* `gate2` — the OS-confined resolver in `crates/tunnel-fs-host`.
* `gate3` — the 9P2000.L codec and session state machine in
  `crates/tunnel-fs-ninep`.
* `gate4` — the endpoint, the dispatcher and the read path, which spans four
  crates: the resolver's metadata and enumeration additions, the provider, the
  relay route and the connector's export.
* `gate5` — write grants and partial failure: the resolver's mutating
  primitives, the hard-link write rule on a real write, and the dispatcher's
  outcome ledger.
* `gate6-e2e` — the validator of the end-to-end gate that drives the real
  TypeScript client against real relay and device sockets.  The gate itself is
  a cluster run and cannot be repeated once per case, so what is measured is
  its **rule list**, against the mutation table that claims every rule of it is
  load-bearing.  Its edits replace a condition with `true` rather than remove
  it: the rules are a fixed-length array, and removing one stops the crate
  compiling, which this script refuses to call a red test.
* `gate6-adapters` — the four native SDK adapters in `packages/client`.  This
  one is **TypeScript**, so its runner is `node --test` rather than `cargo`
  and its not-evidence check is a module that failed to load rather than a
  crate that failed to build.  It needs no install: the suite is the offline
  one, which runs with `node_modules` deleted.
* `gate7-rotation` — the validator of the gate that carries a live 9P session
  across a real scheduled data-socket rotation.  Measured the same way as
  `gate6-e2e`, and for the same reason: the gate is a cluster run.
* `gate9-epoch-change` — the validator of the gate that holds a 9P session
  across a real control-epoch change with a request outstanding.
* `gate8-consumer-loss` — the validator of the gate that loses a 9P consumer
  with a request outstanding and then proves a replacement session restores no
  fids.  Measured the same way, and for the same reason.
* `gate10-process-restart` — the validator of the gate that holds a 9P
  mutation outstanding while the connector's real process is killed, and reads
  the effect count back out of a journal that outlives it.
* `gate13-write-restart` — the validator of the gate that holds a **`Twrite`**
  outstanding while the connector's real process is killed, and classifies the
  bytes it left behind from the export's own host file.  Its region predicate
  admits a **torn** write, which the contract permits and gate 10's
  directory-entry effect cannot express.
* `gate14-rename-restart` — the validator of the gate that holds a
  **`Trename`** outstanding across that same real process kill.  Its evidence
  is the export root's namespace read **per name**, because a count of names
  is invariant across a rename in one directory and so cannot see the
  operation at all; and where gate 13 must *admit* its intermediate state, a
  rename is the one baseline operation `docs/filesystem-api.md` grants backend
  atomicity, so this validator **forbids** both of its intermediate states,
  measures that the inode survived — "do not substitute copy/delete" — and
  discriminates a refusal above the dispatch boundary from one the host made,
  which gate 13 recorded that it could not.
* `gate11-data-recovery` — the validator of the gate that holds a 9P read
  outstanding while the device's data socket is destroyed at the transport and
  the product's own retained recovery replaces it.  Measured the same way, and
  for the same reason.

A guard whose deletion leaves every test green is **not** load-bearing on its
own, and this script prints that outcome rather than hiding it: several of the
resolver's guards mask one another and are red only in pairs or as a triple,
which is why those combinations are cases here in their own right, and the same
honesty applies to gate 3's.

    python3 scripts/fs-guard-deletion.py                 # every case
    python3 scripts/fs-guard-deletion.py --list          # names only
    python3 scripts/fs-guard-deletion.py --suite gate3   # one suite
    python3 scripts/fs-guard-deletion.py --suite gate6-adapters
    python3 scripts/fs-guard-deletion.py --case "32-hop" # substring filter

Exit status is 0 when every case produced a usable result, and 1 when any case
could not be applied or did not build.  **Two refusals keep the numbers honest
and neither may be removed.** Both were added after a round of this evidence
turned out to be wrong in exactly the way the refusal now prevents, and the
numbers in task rows M4-08 and M4-09 rest on them:

1. `run_tests` will not call a failed build a red test.  An early harness
   restored the crate with a checkout between runs, which also reverted an
   uncommitted cargo feature the tests needed, so three cases reported "RED"
   for a build that never compiled.
2. A case whose `old` text is **not unique** in its file is refused outright
   rather than applied to the first match.  `str.replace(old, new, 1)` edits
   whichever match comes first, so an ambiguous case deletes some *other*
   guard and reports a red for it under the wrong name.  That happened twice:
   the `Rlcreate` generation case's text was also the opening of the `Rlopen`
   arm, and the `Rflush` membership case's text appears in `cancel_flush` too.
   Both are anchored now, and the check caught the second one itself.

The working tree must be clean before running.  Not because a restore would
discard uncommitted work -- since M5-C07 each case is restored by writing back
the exact bytes it recorded, so it no longer would -- but because a case
applied on top of an uncommitted edit cannot be told apart from it, and the
run would then credit a guard on the strength of somebody else's change.

# what makes that gate a gate — its **validator**, and the mutation table in the
# same file that asserts every rule of it is load-bearing.  Deleting a rule must
# turn that table red, because the table's whole claim is that no rule is
# decorative; a rule whose deletion leaves it green is a rule the evidence never
# needed.
#
# The edits **replace a condition with `true`** rather than remove the tuple.
# The rule list is a fixed-length array, so removing an entry changes its length
# and the crate stops compiling — and this script refuses to call a failed build
# a red test, so such a case would measure nothing at all.

#: Cases whose **green result is the documented finding**, not a lost guard.
#:
#: This is the exact analogue of `scripts/acp-guard-deletion.py`'s
#: `expect_build_failure`: a third kind of evidence that is reported on its own
#: line and never counted in a red total, because it is not a red test and must
#: not inflate one.
#:
#: A case belongs here only when the suite already argues, in the case's own
#: comment, *why* nothing can go red -- that the rule is defence in depth
#: behind a guard that refuses first.  "It did not go red and I am not sure
#: why" is a stale case (M4-18), which is a different thing and must not be
#: hidden here.
#:
#: A case in this set that **does** go red is an unusable outcome, not a
#: success: it would mean the rule became load-bearing and the comment
#: explaining the green is now wrong.
#: Every entry here must be traceable to a written reason.  The gate-4 five are
#: the five that task row **M4-11** already records and explains, in those
#: words: "the descriptor cache's three generation guards are green
#: individually **and as a triple**, because gate 3's session is already
#: authoritative about a fid's open state per binding and refuses every path
#: that could reach a stale entry ... and the `Treaddir` resume budget answers
#: the same code as the end-of-directory refusal beside it, so no test can tell
#: them apart".
#:
#: They are listed here, rather than left to the row, so the harness's exit
#: status agrees with the row: before this, five documented findings and one
#: real defect all produced the same non-zero exit for different reasons.

# `gate8-consumer-loss` — the validator of the gate that loses a 9P consumer
# with a request outstanding.  Like `gate6-e2e` and `gate7-rotation` this is a
# cluster run that cannot be repeated once per case, so what is measured is its
# **rule list** against the mutation table in the same file.  The edits replace
# a condition with `true` for the same reason: the rule list is a fixed-length
# array and removing an entry stops the crate compiling, which this script
# refuses to call a red test.
#
# This gate's claim has three parts, and the cases are ordered by them.  First,
# that the loss was **concurrent** with a 9P exchange rather than sequential
# with it.  Second, that the session was **cleaned up** — the lost stream gone,
# the device's own session untouched.  Third, and the part the contract turns
# on, that a replacement session **restores no fids**: `docs/protocol.md` says
# the first filesystem profile restores no fids across a consumer WebSocket
# reconnect, so a rule whose deletion leaves the table green would be a rule
# that clause never rested on.
#
# **One of the twenty-three is masked, and this says so rather than hiding it.**
# "the relay had dispatched a record toward the device" is **still green** when
# defeated alone, at 22 of 23 red.  It is not load-bearing on its own because
# the composite rule below it already subsumes it:
# `request_outstanding_at_loss()` returns false unless `emitted_at_loss >
# emitted_before` **and** the receive cursor is unmoved, so the composite
# rejects the very mutation this rule would have caught.  It is kept because it
# names the violated condition precisely when a run fails, which a composite
# cannot; the predicate's own unit test holds that clause directly.  It is
# declared in `EXPECT_GREEN` above, which is the mechanism for exactly this
# claim, so the suite reports it on its own line and exits 0 rather than
# treating a defeated-but-green guard as an unusable outcome.

# `gate10-process-restart` — the validator of the gate that holds a 9P
# **mutation** outstanding while the connector's real operating-system process
# is killed and replaced.  Like `gate7-rotation`, `gate8-consumer-loss` and
# `gate9-epoch-change` this is a harness-side validator, so each case defeats
# one rule and the suite's own unit tests must go red.
#
# Three groups here have no counterpart in gate 9 and are why this gate exists
# as its own suite rather than as a case inside that one:
#
#   * the **journal** rules, which are what make the held call's outcome
#     measurable at all — an in-memory count dies with the process, so without
#     a record taken from the host directory "the count did not increase" would
#     be true of nothing;
#   * the **outcome** rules, which hold that an ambiguous mutation classifies
#     as `Outcome::Unknown` and that `Unknown` is not settled, read out of the
#     library rather than restated here; and
#   * the **process** rules, which are what make the event a restart of a real
#     operating-system process — a recorded pid that exited on a signal, and a
#     replacement under a different one — rather than an in-process handle
#     being dropped and remade, which is gate 9.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `gate11-data-recovery` — the validator of the gate that holds a 9P read
# outstanding while the device's data socket is destroyed at the transport and
# the product's own retained recovery replaces it.  Like `gate7-rotation`,
# `gate8-consumer-loss`, `gate9-epoch-change` and `gate10-process-restart` this
# is a harness-side validator, so each case defeats one rule and the suite's
# own unit tests must go red.
#
# Two groups here have no counterpart in the other four, and are why this gate
# is its own suite rather than a case inside gate 7:
#
#   * the **failure-not-rotation** rules, which are what separate the event the
#     contract licenses from the clean attempt gate 7 drives — a different
#     physical carrier, a strictly greater generation, a completed-rotation
#     count that does not move, and the dead socket's absence at the proxy;
#   * the **same-owner qualifier** rules, which are the *antecedent* of the
#     contract clause rather than part of it.  The profile permits preserving a
#     filesystem session across a failed data socket "only while the same
#     control owner and all ordered stream state are retained", so a gate that
#     observed a surviving fid without them would have recorded the violation
#     and called it the contract.  Each conjunct is separately load-bearing,
#     which the gate's own second unit test defeats one at a time.
#
# Those qualifier rules are **not** stated twice.  Writing each one as its own
# validator rule *as well* was tried, and this suite reported all thirteen
# `still green` when defeated: the antecedent conjunction already rejects every
# run they would have rejected, so none of them could ever be the rule that
# failed a run.  They were removed rather than exempted as documented-green, and
# the property moved to where it can be defeated — the last **fourteen** cases
# here delete one conjunct of `same_owner_contract_qualifiers_held` each, and the
# gate's own `every_same_owner_qualifier_defeats_the_antecedent_on_its_own` is
# what goes red.
#
# That antecedent is written as an **array** rather than as a `&&` chain, and
# this suite is the reason.  As a chain the head conjunct carries no `&&`, so it
# did not match the single edit shape these cases key on and was the one
# conjunct the suite could not defeat — the unfalsifiable-rule problem the
# thirteen removals were meant to cure, reappearing at the one line the edit
# shape could not reach.  Every element of the array has an identical shape, so
# the head is reached like the rest.

# `gate12-rotation-write` — the validator of the gate that holds a **Twrite**
# across one real scheduled rotation and a **Tflush** across the next.  Like
# `gate7-rotation` this is a cluster run that cannot be repeated once per case,
# so what is measured is its **rule list** against the mutation table in the
# same file.  The edits replace a condition with `true` for the same reason:
# the rule list is a fixed-length array and removing an entry stops the crate
# compiling, which this script refuses to call a red test.
#
# The cases that matter most are the ones that make this gate a *write* gate
# rather than a second read gate: that the host directory discriminated a
# written region from an untouched one **in both directions and before the
# event**, that it showed the write performed before the freeze, and that a
# clean scheduled rotation left no ambiguous write.  Without those the gate
# would prove only that a rotation happened near a mutation.
#
# **Two of the forty-one are masked, and this says so rather than hiding it**,
# on exactly gate 7's recorded precedent and for the same reason: the two
# `attempt_active` rules are each still green when defeated alone, because the
# composite rule beside each of them already subsumes it —
# `exchange_in_flight_at_freeze()` returns false unless `attempt_active` is set
# **and** the phase is one of `FROZEN_PHASES`.  They are kept because they name
# the violated condition precisely when a run fails, which a composite cannot.
#
# A rule reading `held_region_before_freeze != RegionState::Torn` was
# **removed** rather than listed here: `held_write_performed_before_freeze()`
# is `== RegionState::Written`, so the torn rule could never have failed a run.
# Its property is held by `a_partly_applied_write_is_torn_and_is_neither_of_
# the_others`, which defeats all four classifications directly, and the removal
# is recorded in M4-06.

# `gate13-write-restart` — the validator of the gate that holds a **`Twrite`**
# outstanding while the connector's real operating-system process is killed and
# replaced.  Like every gate from `gate7-rotation` on this is a cluster run that
# cannot be repeated once per case, so what is measured is its **rule list**
# against the mutation table in the same file, and the edits replace a condition
# with `true` because the rule list is a fixed-length array whose entries cannot
# be removed without stopping the crate compiling.
#
# This suite exists apart from `gate10-process-restart` for the reason the
# module does.  Gate 10's held operation is a `Tlcreate`, whose effect is a
# directory entry: it happened or it did not.  This one's is a `Twrite`, whose
# effect is bytes at an offset and which `docs/filesystem-api.md` explicitly
# permits to **apply partially**.  So the cases that carry this gate are the
# ones gate 10 has no vocabulary for:
#
#   * `the held write had reached the device ...`, whose predicate admits
#     `Written` **and** `Torn`.  Tightening it to `Written` would assert a
#     promise the contract withholds, and
#     `a_torn_held_region_is_accepted_by_every_rule_that_reads_it` is the unit
#     test that goes red if anyone does;
#   * `the bytes the kill left behind were neither completed nor rolled back
#     ...`, which is "does not blindly resubmit the operation in the new
#     session" observed on the effect surface rather than on a reply; and
#   * `the held write classifies as an unknown outcome`, where the caller's
#     entitlement is the same for a torn region as for a whole one because
#     `Outcome::Partial` is defined in terms of an *acknowledged* effect and
#     this caller was acknowledged nothing.
#
# No `!is_settled()` companion rule is listed here because none is written:
# that is the rule gate 10 removed as unable to fail, and the library property
# is held directly by `an_unknown_outcome_is_not_settled_and_a_failed_one_is`.

# `gate14-rename-restart` — the validator of the gate that holds a **`Trename`**
# outstanding while the connector's real operating-system process is killed and
# replaced.  Like every gate from `gate7-rotation` on this is a cluster run that
# cannot be repeated once per case, so what is measured is its **rule list**
# against the mutation table in the same file, and the edits replace a condition
# with `true` because the rule list is a fixed-length array whose entries cannot
# be removed without stopping the crate compiling.
#
# This suite exists apart from `gate10-process-restart` and
# `gate13-write-restart`, and the reason was re-derived rather than inherited
# from the note that deferred this clause.  That note held a `Trename` to be
# "structurally the same evidence shape as gate 10's directory entry, down to
# counting names in a host directory".  **Five of gate 10's six journal rules
# are counts, and a count cannot see a rename**: a rename inside one directory
# removes one name and creates one, so all five read identically either side
# of the operation being measured.  The sixth, `held_effect_exactly_once`, is
# per name — but it is **one-sided**, filtering the final listing for the one
# entry that should *appear*.  A rename is two-sided, so that rule would see
# the destination arrive and say nothing about the source still being there:
# `BothPresent`, the state a copy-then-unlink leaves behind, satisfies it.
# (An earlier version of this comment said gate 10 had no per-name rule at
# all.  It has one; it does not have a two-sided one.)  This suite therefore
# carries cases no other gate has:
#
#   * `the held rename moved a name and left the inode alone ...`, which is
#     `docs/filesystem-api.md`'s "do not substitute copy/delete" measured
#     rather than trusted — a `renameat` moves a name and keeps the inode, and
#     a copy-then-unlink does not.  It is **not** the first measurement of
#     that property: `identity_survives_a_rename` in
#     `crates/tunnel-fs-host/tests/identity_and_aliasing.rs` asserts
#     `Identity::is_same_file` across a direct `ExportRoot::rename`.  What is
#     new is the reading taken **over the 9P wire, across a SIGKILL of the
#     connector process, from the export's own host directory** — the unit
#     test asks the function what it did, this asks the filesystem after the
#     caller is dead;
#   * `no sample ever read the namespace in a state backend atomicity
#     forbids ...`, the **inverse** of gate 13's position on the same event.
#     Gate 13 must *admit* a torn region because the contract permits partial
#     application for a write; a rename is the one baseline operation the same
#     document grants backend atomicity, so its intermediate states are
#     forbidden rather than tolerated;
#   * `the same rename on a valid fid reached the host and was refused for an
#     absent source`.  Gate 13 had to record that its `Einval` was
#     merely *consistent* with a refusal above the dispatch boundary, because
#     `policy::code_from_errno` folds every unrecognised errno into `Einval`
#     too, and it carried the claim on an `mtime` instead.  `Errno::NOENT` is
#     **not** folded — it maps to a distinct `FsErrorCode::Enoent` — and a
#     rename is not idempotent, so the identical operation reaching the host
#     reads differently from one refused above it.  Those two cases are what
#     make this gate's errno proof of origin rather than corroboration; and
#   * `a count of the export root's names was the same either side of the
#     rename ...`, which records the blindness of gate 10's instrument as a
#     measurement of this run rather than as an assertion in a comment.
#
# `the relay had dispatched a 9P record toward the device when the process was
# killed` is shared by name with gate 10 and gate 13 because it is the same
# construction, and it is declared in `EXPECT_GREEN` for the same reason: the
# composite `request_outstanding_at_kill()` beside it is false unless the emit
# cursor advanced **and** the receive cursor did not, so it subsumes this rule.
# It is kept because it names the violated condition precisely when a run fails.
#
# No `!is_settled()` companion rule is listed here because none is written:
# that is the rule gate 10 removed as unable to fail, and the library property
# is held directly by `an_unknown_outcome_is_not_settled_and_a_failed_one_is`.

#: The test(s) each case's deleted guard must make redden, keyed by

#:
#: **Measured, not read off the case text (task row M4-42).**  Every entry
#: below was taken from a run of this harness in which the case's guard was
#: deleted: of the tests that reddened, the entry names those whose path names
#: the mutated file's module (its stem as a `::` segment, or as the test
#: binary), and every reddened test when none does.  All fourteen suites were
#: measured and then re-run in full with these entries in force: gate2, gate3,
#: gate4, gate5 and gate9-epoch-change measured by run `fsdisc-b21c` and
#: re-run by `fsver-3d8e`; gate7, gate8, gate10 and gate11 measured by
#: `fsver-3d8e` and re-run by `fsver2-b6d4`; gate6-adapters, gate6-e2e, gate12,
#: gate13 and gate14 measured by `fsver-3d8e` and re-run by `fsver3-e19a`.  The
#: node suite's names are test titles, so its entries are every reddened test.
#: In every re-run each case was classified plain `RED` --
#: its witness reddened again -- and none `RED (wrong witness)`.  A case whose
#: entry is wrong fails the next run closed, which is the point: an entry is a
#: claim the harness re-checks every time, not a label.
#:
