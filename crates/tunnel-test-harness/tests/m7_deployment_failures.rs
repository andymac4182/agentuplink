//! Process-bound M7 bootstrap fault acceptance.
//!
//! Every case uses the configured relay executable and real Redis/checkpoint
//! authorities.  The matrix deliberately stops at the bootstrap boundary:
//! malformed or unavailable trust inputs must produce bounded typed diagnostics,
//! never ready/admitted listeners, and released ports.
//!
//! The matrix covers FP-10's bootstrap prerequisites: local peer identity,
//! signed membership, signed checkpoint authority, Redis authority, peer
//! reachability, and capacity.  Runtime loss of an authority after a ready
//! start is `m7_deployment_runtime_faults.rs`.
//!
//! Peer reachability is the one prerequisite whose documented startup contract
//! is not "exit with a typed diagnostic".  A relay whose signed membership
//! names a peer it cannot reach must stay alive and observably live, fail
//! readiness closed, and then converge to ready when that peer appears, with
//! no restart: requiring an exit there would make two relays booting together
//! deadlock on each other.  `Fault::UnreachablePeer` asserts that contract at
//! process level instead of the exit-and-release flow the other faults use.

// The harness library is Unix-only (see `src/entry.rs`).
