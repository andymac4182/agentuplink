# Demo: computer use (CUA) through a local relay

Status: written for task rows M5-C20 to M5-C28 on 2026-09-26, on branch
`feat-cua-demo`. It covers a Linux guest only; macOS and Windows guests are
not built yet (see [What is not covered](#what-is-not-covered)).

## Reuse an already prepared synthetic guest

`scripts/m5-cua-demo-reuse.sh` uses an existing running Tart Linux fixture VM;
it never clones, stops or deletes that VM. It needs the same ARM64 client built
with `--features cua`, deadman, host relay, existing probe SSH identity and
fixture provisioning as the original demo. It starts its own dedicated Redis
using an existing `redis-server` binary. Do not run it against a personal desktop.

Before setting `CUA_REUSE_APPROVED=1`, approve the specific VM, IP and new guest
workspace, ephemeral test PKI and loopback listeners. Certificates last one day,
tokens 15 minutes; keys and bearer headers stay in the run's protected secrets
directory. The guest workspace must not exist already. Host ports are fixed:
consumer 18443, device 18444, Redis 16398 and Redis TLS 18445. The temporary SSH
reverse forward binds guest `127.0.0.1:18444` to host `127.0.0.1:18444` and uses
the existing login. No system trust, firewall, SSH policy or autostart changes.

```bash
CUA_REUSE_APPROVED=1 CUA_VM=approved-fixture-vm \
CUA_GUEST_IP=192.168.64.25 CUA_GUEST_WORKSPACE=/home/cua/cua-demo-reuse \
TEST_REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:16398/0 \
REDIS_BIN=/path/to/existing/redis-server GUEST_BIN_DIR=/path/to/arm64/binaries \
RELAY_BIN=/path/to/tunnel-relay scripts/m5-cua-demo-reuse.sh /path/to/evidence
```

The runner first requires HTTP 401 for an unauthenticated request at the exact
relay route. The consumer calls only the relay's HTTP/2 computer route. It checks fixture
markers before input, both unleased and post-release refusal, lease acquire and
release, exact application text/click state, and superseded-capture refusal.
`--reset-entry` replaces an already populated synthetic Tk entry for repeat runs.
The runner cleans up its own processes, forwards and credentials on exit or
INT/TERM, retaining the guest workspace when cleanup cannot be verified. SIGKILL
or loss of guest access requires inspecting the task-owned resources before
reusing that workspace. Offline CI checks do not access a desktop; VM acceptance
remains a separate local gate, with no rotation, cluster or full-M5 claim.

A consumer on your Mac takes a screenshot of a synthetic app, clicks it and
types into it. The app runs in a **disposable Linux VM**, and every request
goes consumer → local `tunnel-relay` → `tunnel-client` in the VM → the pinned
`cua-computer-server` 0.3.46 on the VM's loopback. The consumer never talks
to the CUA server directly.

```

The relay listens on **host loopback only**. The guest reaches the relay's
device port through an SSH *reverse* forward over Tart's private network,
authenticated by the guest's own host key. So the macOS application
firewall, which silently dropped the guest's direct connection in demo run 4,
needs no exception, and no host security setting is changed.

## Safety: read this first

- **Computer control runs only inside the Tart guest** (a clone of
  `cua-golden`, deleted when the demo exits). Nothing on the host captures the
  screen or sends input. **Do not grant Screen Recording or Accessibility to
  any host process**: nothing here needs them.
- The CUA export exists only in a `tunnel-client` built with the non-default
  `cua` feature, and even that build refuses to serve it unless
  `AGENT_TUNNEL_CUA_LANE_B=1` is set. Release binaries do not have the
  feature.
- Before the first request, the script checks that the relay is the **only**
  listener on its consumer and device ports. Before any input, a screenshot
  taken **through the tunnel** must show the fixture's five marker colours;
  otherwise the consumer sends no input and the run fails.
- All data is synthetic. Tokens and keys live in a `0700` temporary directory
  that is deleted on exit. The bearer token is passed to `curl` in a header
  file, never on a command line. Typed text is never logged.

> **Grant scope: read this before exporting anything but this demo VM.**
> The relay grants `http:invoke` on the whole service. It does not grant
> individual operations, so **every principal granted the service may use
> every operation the export lists** (task row M5-C28, a blocker for any
> hosted or non-VM use). An input-capable export must list only operations
> that every grantee may use. For read-only access, list only `describe`,
> `capture`, `screen_info` and `cursor_position`.

## Prerequisites

| What | Why | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Silicon Mac | Tart runs Linux arm64 guests | `uname -m` prints `arm64` |
| Tart **2.38.0** | the VM; the script refuses other versions | `~/.local/bin/tart --version` |
| `cua-golden` built by `scripts/m5-cua-vm.sh golden` | the hardened, hash-locked image | `tart list` shows `cua-golden` |
| ≥ 20 GiB free after the step | the scripts' disk floor | `df -h ~/.tart` |
| A disposable plaintext Redis | the relay's catalog; a TLS terminator is put in front of it | `redis-cli -p 63790 ping` |
| `openssl`, `python3`, `curl` with HTTP/2 | PKI, helper tools, the consumer | `curl -V` lists `HTTP2` |

Building `cua-golden` downloads about 5 GB and takes about 30 minutes; see
[testing.md, Disposable Linux CUA VM](../testing.md#disposable-linux-cua-vm-apple-silicon-host).

## Run it

From the repository root:

```sh
# 1. The golden image (once; --rebuild replaces an existing one).
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" scripts/m5-cua-vm.sh golden --rebuild

# 2. The guest binaries: tunnel-client with the cua feature, and the
#    tunnel-deadman sentinel, built INSIDE a disposable clone (same Ubuntu,
#    same glibc as the guest). Committed code only (git archive HEAD).
cargo fetch --locked
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" scripts/m5-cua-vm.sh build-client /tmp/cua-guest-bin

# 3. The host relay.
cargo build --locked -p tunnel-relay --bin tunnel-relay

# 4. The demo: clone, relay, device, consumer, verdict, teardown.
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" TART="$HOME/.local/bin/tart" \
TEST_REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:63790/0 GUEST_BIN_DIR=/tmp/cua-guest-bin \
RELAY_BIN="${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-target}/debug/tunnel-relay" \
  scripts/m5-cua-demo.sh /tmp/cua-demo-evidence
```

`build-client` takes about 20 minutes on 4 vCPU. It downloads `rustup` and
the pinned 1.95.0 toolchain from the official Rust distribution **inside the
clone**; crates come from your host's cargo registry, so the build itself is
`--offline --locked`. A Docker cross-build (`rust:1.95.0`, Debian 13, glibc
2.41) was tried first. It is not recommended: its I/O through bind mounts
stalled, and its glibc is newer than the guest's 2.39.

## What the script does

1. **Clones and boots** `cua-demo-<nonce>` from `cua-golden`, and waits until a
   root capture *inside the guest* shows the fixture's red marker.
2. **Makes synthetic PKI** on the host: a server CA and a relay certificate
   for `relay.cua-demo.test`, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`, a device CA, and an RSA identity issuer with a JWKS. All keys stay in a
   `0700` temporary directory, which is deleted on exit.
3. **Starts a TLS terminator** in front of the plaintext Redis
   (`tunnel-relay serve` requires `rediss://`).
4. **Enrols the device inside the guest** as the `cua` user:
   `tunnel-client credentials create` makes the key and CSR in the guest (the
   private key never leaves it); the host signs the CSR with the device CA,
   adding `URI:urn:agent-tunnel:device:<uuid>`; `credentials import` installs
   it. The guest's `/etc/hosts` maps `relay.cua-demo.test` to its own loopback,
   and, once the relay is serving, an `ssh -R` forward carries that port to
   the relay's device listener. The script refuses to go on unless `sshd` is
   the only listener on the guest port.
5. **Provisions and starts the relay** with
   [`examples/m6-catalog-cua.toml`](../../examples/m6-catalog-cua.toml)
   (`http_forward_profile = "computer-v1"`) and `[http_forward] profiles =
   ["computer-v1"]`: dry run, `activate-first-incarnation`,
   `provision-catalog`, `serve`.
6. **Starts the device**: `tunnel-client connect` with
   `AGENT_TUNNEL_CUA_LANE_B=1` and this export table:

   ```toml
   [exports."77777777-7777-4777-8777-777777777777"]
   type = "http-forward"

   [exports."77777777-7777-4777-8777-777777777777".cua]
   profile = "computer-v1"
   point_width = 1280
   point_height = 800
   operations = ["describe", "capture", "screen_info", "cursor_position", "click",
                 "double_click", "move", "drag", "scroll", "type_text", "press_key", "hotkey"]

   [exports."77777777-7777-4777-8777-777777777777".cua.backend]
   command = "/opt/cua-fixture/cua-backend-supervised.sh"
   args = ["/home/cua/cua-export/backend.address"]
   workspace = "/home/cua/cua-export"
   address_file = "/home/cua/cua-export/backend.address"
   env = { PATH = "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin", HOME = "/home/cua" }
   startup_seconds = 90
   ```

   On the first request, the export starts
   [`cua-backend-supervised.sh`](../../tests/cua-fixture/cua-backend-supervised.sh).
   The wrapper binds the server to a free guest-loopback port and publishes
   the address only once `/status` answers. The export then probes
   `screen_info` (read-only, never a click) and reads `/commands` and
   `version`. It negotiates the operation set, and it declares the point space
   only if `get_screen_size` equals it.
7. **Runs the consumer**
   ([`scripts/m5-cua-demo.py consumer`](../../scripts/m5-cua-demo.py)), which
   `POST`s `computer.v1` bodies over HTTP/2 to
   `https://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1/devices/<device>/services/<service>/http/computer`:
   `describe`, `screen_info`, `cursor_position`, `capture` (with the marker
   check), a click **without** the lease (it must be refused), then
   `acquire_input_lease`. With the lease it clicks the text field, runs
   `type_text`, and clicks the button. It then takes a new `capture`, clicks
   on the **old** capture (it must be refused as superseded), and runs
   `release_input_lease`.
8. **Reads the verdict from the app's own state file** in the guest
   (`/tmp/cua-fixture/state.json`): exactly one more click, and the text
   field holds exactly the typed text.
9. **M5-C09a probe (guest only, after the device has stopped).** It holds the
   left button and Shift through the server's `mouse_down`/`key_down`, then
   reads the X server's pointer mask and keymap in three states: after the
   HTTP client has gone, after the server is `SIGKILL`ed, and after a
   guest-side `xdotool` cleanup.
10. **Tears down** on any exit: the device, relay and terminator stop, the
    Redis namespace is deleted, and the clone is stopped and deleted.

## Expected output

A passing run, abridged (demo run 8, nonce `5b9a30fd13f1`, recorded in
[`tests/cua-fixture/evidence/2026-09-26-linux-aarch64-tunnel-demo/`](../../tests/cua-fixture/evidence/2026-09-26-linux-aarch64-tunnel-demo/)).
Ports, addresses and timings vary. The first `describe` is slow because it
starts the backend:

```text
m5-cua-vm: cua-demo-5b9a30fd13f1: X session up, fixture mapped, root capture shows the markers

redis-clean namespace=m5-cua-demo-5b9a30fd13f1 deleted=23
m5-cua-vm: cua-demo-5b9a30fd13f1 deleted
```

The script exits 0 only if `verdict.json` has `"ok": true`. That requires
all of these: exactly one more click in the app, the field equal to the typed
text, the markers matched, the unleased click refused `lease_not_held`, and
the stale click refused `capture_superseded`. The `Terminated` line after
teardown is the Redis TLS terminator being stopped. In `OUTDIR` the typed
text is replaced by its length and SHA-256.

`OUTDIR` holds `consumer.json` (every call's outcome and timing; for each
capture, the image's SHA-256, size and marker colours instead of the image),
`screenshot-tunnel.png` (the synthetic frame as the consumer received it),
`fixture-state-before.json` and `fixture-state-after.json`, `manifest.json`
(the guest's OS, display, keyboard and package versions), `residue-probe.json`,
`verdict.json`, and the relay and device logs.

## The wire, by example

Every answer is HTTP 200 with a `computer.v1` body. **Read `outcome`, not the
status.**

```sh
# describe: answered from the negotiated set, no backend exchange
{"version":"computer.v1","operation":"describe","params":{}}
# -> {"outcome":"answered_locally","result":{"operations":[...],"endpoint_is_loopback":true},...}

# the input lease has a wire form in this export (task row M5-C20)
{"version":"computer.v1","operation":"acquire_input_lease","params":{}}
# -> {"outcome":"answered_locally","result":{"held":true,"lease":1,"target":"primary"},...}

# capture: the device reads the PNG's dimensions and issues a capture id
{"version":"computer.v1","operation":"capture","params":{}}
# -> {"outcome":"ok","result":{"capture":1,"display":0,"image_data":"<base64 PNG>","format":"png",...}}

# click: coordinates are pixels of a named capture
{"version":"computer.v1","operation":"click","params":{"capture":1,"x":180,"y":180}}
# -> {"outcome":"ok",...}
```

| `outcome` | Meaning | Retry? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | dispatched and succeeded | n/a |
| `answered_locally` | answered by the device, nothing sent to the backend | safe |
| `not_dispatched` | refused before dispatch, for example `lease_not_held`, `capture_superseded`, `capture_scale_undeclared`, `not_permitted`, `backend_unavailable` or `principal_binding_missing` (no relay principal binding; never through the relay) | `error.retryable` says |
| `failed` | dispatched and the backend reported failure | only for reads |
| `unknown` | dispatched, and the effect is not known | **never** |

## If it fails

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| `tart ... is not the pinned 2.38.0` | Put Tart 2.38.0 first on `PATH`, or set `TART`. |
| `aborting: free space would drop below 20 GiB` | Free disk space, or run `scripts/m5-cua-vm.sh destroy-golden` and rebuild later. |
| `X session / fixture did not start` | Guest boot problem: `KEEP_VM=1` keeps the clone; inspect `~/.local/state/agentuplink-m5-cua-vm/logs/`. |
| `port N listeners are '...', expected only the relay` | Something else is listening on the chosen port. Rerun (ports are chosen per run); never skip the check. |
| `device not ready` with `TLS/WebSocket handshake deadline exceeded` | The device cannot reach the relay. The script uses an SSH reverse forward for exactly this reason; check that `~/.local/state/agentuplink-m5-cua-vm/id_ed25519` exists (made by `golden`). Do not open a host firewall port. |
| `device not ready`, other | Read `OUTDIR/connect.log`. `this tunnel-client was built without the cua feature` means `GUEST_BIN_DIR` holds the wrong build; `set AGENT_TUNNEL_CUA_LANE_B=1` means the opt-in did not reach the process. |
| `Redis root CA path contains a symlink` | The relay refuses symlinked TLS paths; the script resolves its work directory with `pwd -P`. If you changed `TMPDIR`, keep it a physical path. |
| every call `not_permitted` | Negotiation found nothing. On a current branch this means the backend's `/commands` was unreadable (M5-C27). Read the server log in the guest (`KEEP_VM=1`). |
| `backend_unavailable` on the first call | The supervised server did not come up within `startup_seconds`. Read `/tmp/cua-server-*.log` in the guest (`KEEP_VM=1`). |
| `frame is not the fixture; no input will be sent` | The screenshot did not show the markers (for example the black-root-framebuffer defect in testing.md). No input was sent; that is the gate working. |
| `capture_scale_undeclared` on a click | `point_width`/`point_height` disagree with the guest's `get_screen_size` (M5-C19): the export refused to declare them. Fix the export table. |
| A leftover `cua-demo-*` VM | `tart list`, then `scripts/m5-cua-vm.sh destroy <name>`. |
| Leftover Redis keys | `python3 scripts/m5-cua-demo.py redis-clean 127.0.0.1:63790 0 m5-cua-demo-<nonce>`. |

## What is not covered

- **macOS and Windows guests** (M5-03): not built. The macOS path needs a
  golden image with Screen Recording and Accessibility granted to the
  server's Python *inside the guest*, and a permission-denied variant.
  Windows needs an interactive (not Session 0) desktop.
- **A non-identity display scale** (M5-C19): the Linux guest runs at 1x, so
  the point-space derivation is proven at 2x only against the Lane A
  fixture.
- **Session eviction and an idle bound on a lease holder** (M5-C29).
- **Restart on a failed health probe** (M5-C23), **grant revision delivery**
  (M5-C05) and **per-operation grants** (M5-C28).
- **CI**: the Lane B tests need `--features cua`, which the workspace run
  and hosted CI do not build (M5-C24).
- **Cancellation, lost-answer, unsupported-capability and permission-denied
  fixtures over the tunnel** (M5-03, M5-04), and the `vnc` and `cua-driver`
  backends through the tunnel (M5-C02).
- **A second principal through the relay**: the second-agent lease refusal
  is proven against the fixture (`cua_export::tests`), not through the relay.
