#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Implementation gate 2 of `docs/http-forwarding.md`: the `http-forward/1`
//! codec connected to an in-process streaming Rust HTTP handler.
//!
//! * [`owner::forward`] is the ingress adapter.  It normalizes an
//!   [`http::Request`] with a streaming body, writes `REQUEST_HEAD`, `BODY*`,
//!   `END` and FIN onto a bounded [`stream::FrameSender`], and concurrently
//!   decodes the response direction into an [`http::Response`] whose body
//!   streams.
//! * [`device::serve`] is the handler adapter.  It decodes the request
//!   direction, builds a typed [`http::Request`] and calls an in-process
//!   handler directly: there is no address, listener or socket anywhere in
//!   this crate.  The handler's response is encoded as `RESPONSE_HEAD`,
//!   `BODY*`, `END` and FIN.
//! * [`stream`] is the bounded stand-in for one logical tunnel stream: a
//!   byte-credited queue with ordered FIN and a reserved-capacity RESET.
//!   Gate 3 replaces it with the real owner/peer/device carriers.
//!
//! Both directions of an exchange run concurrently, every queue is bounded,
//! and no lock is held across an await.  Failures before response headers
//! become scoped gateway responses with sanitized `code`/`execution`
//! metadata; failures after headers error the body stream and emit RESET,
//! never a fabricated END.
