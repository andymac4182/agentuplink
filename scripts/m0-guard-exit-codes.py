"""Defeat one operator-surface guard at a time, run the tests it should
protect, and restore it.

This is the red-then-green evidence behind two of M0-03's client operator
surfaces: the exit-code vocabulary the row was opened for, and the `doctor`
report (M6-C07).  The guards live in `crates/tunnel-client/src/main.rs` and
`crates/tunnel-client/src/doctor.rs` and are witnessed by that binary's unit
tests plus the real-process fixtures in
`crates/tunnel-client/tests/exit_codes_cli.rs` and
`crates/tunnel-client/tests/doctor_cli.rs`.

**The filename says exit codes and the harness now covers more than that.**
Kept here rather than split into a second file because the witness suite is
the same one -- `cargo test -p tunnel-client` builds and runs every target
both surfaces are witnessed by -- and a harness that names a different
package than the tests it runs is the M3-19 failure this whole family of
scripts exists to avoid.  A second file would have had to duplicate the
suite definition to avoid duplicating nothing.

A third suite, `m0c06-recovery-debug`, covers task row M0-06: the relay's
recovery-workflow `Debug` redaction, whose test could not tell redaction from
deletion.  It lives here because it is the same kind of evidence -- an
operator diagnostic's redaction -- and names its own package, as the
classifier suite does.

**What the row is about.** `CliError::exit_code` used to match `&'static str`
with a `_ => 1` arm.  Six live causes had no entry in that table, so they
exited `1`, "unexpected internal failure" -- including `OWNER_BUSY` (another
connector already holds the device) and `CANCELLED` (the session was
interrupted).  Those need different operator actions and the process's exit
status, the first thing a supervisor or a tester reads, said the same thing
about all of them.  The fix replaces the string table with a closed `Cause`
enum matched exhaustively.

**Two kinds of case live here, and the distinction is the point.**

* Cases marked `expect_build_failure` are the *totality* rule.  Removing an
  arm from `Cause::exit_code`, `Cause::code` or `Cause::from_client` makes
  the match non-exhaustive, and the crate does not compile.  These are
  reported as `REFUSED BY COMPILER` and are **never counted as a red test**:
  a build failure names no behaviour, and counting it as one would credit the
  guard for a failure that says nothing.  They are still worth running,
  because a `_` arm reintroduced anywhere would turn the refusal into a
  silent green -- which is the original defect returning.
* Every other case edits a *value* the compiler cannot check -- which number
  a cause maps to, which string it publishes, whether a transport detail is
  appended to a message -- and must turn **the test it names** red.  Each
  such case declares `expected_red`, and a run in which those tests are not
  among the failures reports `RED (wrong witness)`, which is not a usable
  outcome and fails the run.  This is stricter than the other four harnesses
  here, which accept any named failure; see `Case` for the measured reason.

**One rule is deliberately not here.**  Exit `6` (`OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`) is
documented in `docs/runtime.md` and has no producer in this binary, so there
is nothing to defeat.  A case for it would have to add the producer first,
and an addition is not a deletion: it would measure the case's own code.
The gap is named in `docs/runtime.md` and in M0-03 instead of being faked
here.

It follows `scripts/m3-guard-deletion.py`, `scripts/acp-guard-deletion.py`,
`scripts/fs-guard-deletion.py` and `scripts/m5-guard-deletion.py`,
**including their refusals, none of which may be removed**:

1. `run_tests` will not call a failed build a red test.
2. A case whose `old` text is not unique in its file is refused outright
   rather than applied to the first match.
3. A run that timed out returns `NOT EVIDENCE (timed out)`, not `RED (hung)`.

and adds a fourth of its own:

4. A red test that is not the one the case named is `RED (wrong witness)`,
   and a value case that names no test at all is refused before any file is
   edited.

The classification of those outcomes lives in `scripts/guard_outcomes.py`,
shared with the other harnesses, and is an allow list: everything that is not
a usable outcome fails closed.

    **`expected_red` is the reason this is a class and not the 3-tuple the
    other four harnesses use.**  Those harnesses classify a case as `RED` on
    *any* named failing test, so a case can be green-lit by a test that has
    nothing to do with the rule it claims to prove.  That is not theoretical
    here: the redaction case below was first written with a single edit and
    reported `RED` -- against an unrelated `m2_runtime` rotation test, while
    the fixture it existed for stayed green.  It was caught only because the
    wrong witness happened to be *visibly* unrelated.  A wrong witness that
    reddens something plausible is invisible, and a tally of such cases reads
    exactly like a tally of real ones.

    So every value case names the test(s) that must be among the failures.
    If they are not, the outcome is `RED (wrong witness)`, which is not in
    `guard_outcomes.USABLE_OUTCOMES` and therefore fails the run.  A value
    case with no declared witness is refused before anything is edited.

    `expect_build_failure` cases declare none: a build failure names no test,
