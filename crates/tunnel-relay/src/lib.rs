//! The M1 relay runtime.
//!
//! The relay owns one bounded actor for all live device sessions.  Axum
//! handlers authenticate and validate requests, then send typed commands to
//! that actor; handlers never mutate socket or epoch state themselves.  The
//! device listener is intended to be run through `tunnel-transport`, which
//! performs mandatory mTLS and injects the verified [`tunnel_transport::TlsIdentity`]
//! extension before the WebSocket upgrade.
