//! A private, payload-free metrics listener (task row M6-C24).
//!
//! `serve` opens it only when `metrics_bind` is configured, and only on a
//! loopback or private address: it is plain HTTP with no authentication, so
//! its protection is where it listens.  It serves one route, `GET /metrics`,
//! in the Prometheus text format (version 0.0.4); everything else is `404`.
//! It is never merged into the public consumer or device routers, so
//! `/metrics` stays off the public surface (M7-I04 asserts that).
//!
//! **What a scrape can contain.** Every series is an aggregate: a count, a
//! gauge or a byte total.  Every label value is a fixed word from a closed
//! set in this crate (a route, a refusal stage, a peer-fault stage or cause,
//! an authority failure class) or the crate version.  No tenant, device,
//! session, connection, stream or operation identifier, subject, issuer,
//! token, URL, path, endpoint, error text or payload byte is ever rendered;
//! [`render`] reads identifiers from the snapshot only to count them, and
//! `metrics_tests.rs` seeds canaries into every identifier field to prove it.
//!
//! **Bounds.** One scrape at a time (a concurrent one gets `503`); the actor
//! snapshot is bounded by [`SNAPSHOT_DEADLINE`]; the body's size is bounded by
//! the closed label sets.  The listener itself ([`serve_bounded`]) holds at
//! most [`MAX_CONNECTIONS`] connections, closing any beyond that at accept;
//! each must send its request head within [`HEADER_TIMEOUT`], serves one
//! request (no keep-alive) and is closed after [`CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`] however
//! far it got, so an idle or slow client cannot hold a connection open
//! (PR #158 review).
