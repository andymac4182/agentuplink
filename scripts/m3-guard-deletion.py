"""Defeat one process-containment guard at a time, run the tests it should
protect, and restore it.

This is the red-then-green evidence behind M3-09.  Two suites live here
(later suites -- M6-C08's doctor, M3-25's pin wait, M7-C89's readiness
against the pin set and M7-C92/M7-C93's finite echo -- are described where
they are defined):

* `m3c09` — `crates/tunnel-deadman` and the stdio export's child supervision
  in `crates/tunnel-mcp-export`, witnessed by the process-table measurements
  in `crates/tunnel-mcp-fixture/tests/process_residue.rs`: the sentinel firing
  on a bare end of file, the sentinel being armed at all, the stand-down on
  the orderly path, and the fixture's own honesty about whether it really
  detached.
* `m3c09-deadman` — the resolution rule that decides whether an installation
  is watched at all, witnessed by `tunnel-deadman`'s own unit tests.

**One rule of M3-09 is deliberately not here**, and is recorded in that row's
"Not covered" list instead: the *ordering* of the stand-down against the group
kill.  Hoisting the stand-down above the kill leaves every test in both suites
green — measured by doing it, not inferred — and the reason is not the obvious
one — on a hoist the sentinel does not
fire early, it **does not fire at all**.  `watch` returns `EXIT_STOOD_DOWN` on
the stand-down token without calling `kill_group`, so in both orderings the
group is killed by the supervisor's own `kill_group` and the sentinel exits
stood-down either way; the `deadman_stood_down` counter reads that exit status,
so it increments in both.

What the ordering really guards is a **crash window**: the hoist leaves the
group alive and unwatched between the two calls, so a `SIGKILL` of the device
inside it leaks the group.  It is microseconds wide and cannot be hit
deterministically without widening it — and widening it is an **addition**,
which a deletion case may not make.  Hence no case, rather than a case that
would pass either way and look like coverage.

**The fourth case is not like the others and is the point of having it.**  It
defeats the *fixture*, not the product: it makes the escaping descendant fail
to escape.  Every containment measurement in `process_residue.rs` is built on
a descendant that genuinely left the process group, and a fixture that quietly
stopped detaching would turn those measurements into a test of nothing while
leaving them green.  The case proves the tests refuse that fixture instead of
reporting it as containment.

It follows `scripts/acp-guard-deletion.py`, `scripts/fs-guard-deletion.py` and
`scripts/m5-guard-deletion.py`, **including their refusals, none of which may
be removed**:

1. `run_tests` will not call a failed build a red test.  A deleted guard can
   leave the crate unbuildable, and counting that as evidence would credit the
   guard for a failure that says nothing about behaviour.
2. A case whose `old` text is **not unique** in its file is refused outright
   rather than applied to the first match.  `str.replace(old, new, 1)` edits
   whichever match comes first, so an ambiguous case would defeat some *other*
   guard and report a red for it under the wrong name.
3. A run that *timed out* returns `NOT EVIDENCE (timed out)`, not `RED (hung)`:
   a timed-out run names no failing test.

The classification of those outcomes is **not in this file**.  It lives in
`scripts/guard_outcomes.py`, shared with the other harnesses, and it is an
**allow list**: everything that is not a usable outcome fails closed.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/m3-guard-deletion.py            # every case
    python3 scripts/m3-guard-deletion.py --list
    python3 scripts/m3-guard-deletion.py --case sentinel

#: The re-sign pin-availability rule (M3-25 / M7-C89), in its own suite for
#: the same M3-19 reason as the others: it edits `tunnel-test-harness`, and
#: only a `cargo test -p tunnel-test-harness` invocation rebuilds it.
#:
#: **Why the rule is witnessed through scripted relays rather than through the
#: gate it protects.**  The condition the wait exists for is rare in every
#: population M3-25 measured, and those populations differ, so each is named
#: rather than rounded into one figure: 1 M3-04 red in 26 baseline isolation
#: re-signs (3.8%); 2 engagements in 109 post-fix re-signs across three gates
#: (1.8%), both in cloud-client and none in the 59 isolation re-signs.  A case
#: witnessed by `verify-m3-mcp-isolation` would therefore be green almost every
#: time **with the rule deleted** -- the M5-C11 shape this whole family of
#: harnesses exists to refuse: a case whose defeat and whose success look the
#: same.
#:
#: **Decision and application are witnessed separately, and the second was
#: missing.**  The first three cases defeat `pin_publication_outstanding`, the
#: rule's *decision*.  Their witnesses call that function (or the wait loop)
#: directly, so none of them could see whether the wait was ever *applied*:
#: the Fable review of `3cf2c1e` measured that deleting the call site, or
#: making the bound proceed instead of failing, still left this suite at three
#: of three.  The call site now lives in `settle_resign` -- moved out of
#: `resign_membership_now`, which needs a Redis-backed cluster and so no unit
#: test could reach -- and the last two cases defeat the application, each
#: witnessed by a test that drives the path it defeats.
#:
#: **Still not witnessed here, and said rather than implied:** the single line
#: in `resign_membership_now` that calls `settle_resign`.  Replacing it with a
#: literal skips convergence and the pin wait together, and only the cluster
#: gates would notice.  Convergence was never unit-witnessed before this suite
#: existed; the pin wait no longer adds to that surface.
#:
#: Several filters, not one prefix, because the witnesses do not share one.
#: libtest accepts any number of filters after `--`, and runs a test that
#: matches any of them.
