//! The connector-facing half of the provider's interface: what it reads the
//! live authorization through, and the counters it reports.
//!
//! **Portable, unlike the dispatcher.** [`crate::Provider`] needs the
//! Unix-only resolver in `tunnel-fs-host`, so it is `cfg(unix)`; these types
//! need nothing from the host. `tunnel-client` names all three in code that
//! exists on every host -- the stream authority it shares with a provider,
//! and the per-session ledger it sums -- so while they lived beside the
//! dispatcher, `tunnel-client` did not compile for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`,
//! one of the four release targets.
