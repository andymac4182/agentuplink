/**
 * The Mastra adapter: one granted export, seen as a `WorkspaceFilesystem`.
 *
 * `@mastra/core` 1.65.0 defines `WorkspaceFilesystem` with eleven asynchronous
 * operations, four identity properties and an optional lifecycle, and a
 * `Workspace` is constructed with an instance of it. This module implements
 * that interface over the shared client, with **type-only** imports of the
 * upstream declarations, so `tsc` checks it against the installed package's own
 * `.d.ts` and nothing of `@mastra/core` loads at run time.
 *
 * ## The interface rather than the base class, deliberately
 *
 * `docs/filesystem-adapters.md` says "preferably extending `MastraFilesystem`".
 * That class extends `MastraBase` for logger injection, so extending it is a
 * **value** import of `@mastra/core` — which would make this package's Mastra
 * entry point load the framework, and would put a framework dependency inside a
 * package whose whole shape is that it has none. Upstream sanctions the other
 * half of the choice in the class's own documentation: "External providers can
 * extend this class to get logger support, or implement the WorkspaceFilesystem
 * interface directly if they don't need logging." This implements the
 * interface. The cost is named rather than hidden: **no Mastra logger reaches
 * this adapter**, so its diagnostics go through its own return values and its
 * errors, not through `this.logger`.
 *
 * ## The error classes are injected
 *
 * Mastra's errors are runtime classes and its tools branch on them with
 * `instanceof`. Building a structurally similar object would not be one. So the
 * consumer hands over the classes from its own `@mastra/core/workspace`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import * as workspace from '@mastra/core/workspace';
 * const filesystem = new TunnelMastraFilesystem({ remote, errors: workspace });
 * ```
 *
 * ## `partial` and `unknown`
 *
 * Mastra's `FilesystemError(message, code, path)` has a free-form `code` and no
 * outcome concept. An ambiguous mutation therefore becomes a plain
 * `FilesystemError` with code `TUNNEL_PARTIAL` or `TUNNEL_UNKNOWN` and the
 * shared client's own error as `cause`. Two things follow, and both are
 * deliberate:
 *
 * * Such a failure is **never** reported as one of Mastra's semantic errors.
 *   `FileNotFoundError` after a half-applied write would tell a caller the file
 *   is absent; `FileExistsError` would tell it the write was refused. Neither
 *   is true, and both read as "nothing happened".
 * * A caller switching on Mastra's own error classes falls through to a
 *   default. That is the correct outcome and it is the limit of what this
 *   interface can express: there is no field a Mastra tool already reads that
 *   would carry `partial`.
 *
 * ## Paths in messages
 *
 * Mastra's `FilesystemError` takes a `path` and renders it into `message`. The
 * payload-free rule forbids a **host** path, a host identity or content; the
 * path here is the *virtual* path the caller itself supplied, which the shared
 * client already carries as a field for the same reason. Nothing host-derived
 * is ever passed, and a `readdir` name that came from the device is only
 * combined into a virtual path the caller could have written itself.
