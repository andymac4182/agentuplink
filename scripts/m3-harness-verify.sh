# M3-09.  These read the process table for what the stdio export's children
# left behind, and one of them SIGKILLs a supervisor, so they are registered
# here rather than left to `cargo test --workspace` alone: a gate names the
# claim, and a green workspace run does not.  `--test-threads=1` because the
# measurements are of a shared, global resource — the process table — and two
# of them running at once would read each other's descendants.
#
# These tests `exec` the `tunnel-mcp-fixture` and `tunnel-deadman` binaries and
# `cargo test --test` builds neither (M3-19), so they depend on the workspace
# `--bins` build above having already refreshed them.  Do not reorder them.
