//! Owner-actor support for `http-forward/1` logical streams (implementation
//! gates 3 and 4 of docs/http-forwarding.md).
//!
//! An HTTP stream reuses the M2 stream admission, authorization challenge,
//! sequence, replay, rotation-freeze and FORGET machinery of the consumer
//! echo stream.  It differs in these ways:
//!
//! * DATA carries raw `http-forward/1` record bytes: no length prefix, and a
//!   write resolves when its chunk is sequenced (or parks for send credit or
//!   replay capacity), not when a response record arrives.
//! * The directions are independent half-closes.  A connector FIN only ends
//!   the response direction; the owner neither marks the stream terminal nor
//!   answers it with its own FIN.  The owner's FIN is an explicit request.
//! * Received DATA stays in a per-stream buffer charged to the session
//!   budget until the reader takes it.  WINDOW_UPDATE is issued only then,
//!   so the connector can never have more unread bytes queued here than the
//!   owner's advertised window.
//! * A connector RESET is also published out of band (with whether it
//!   followed the connector's FIN), and a matching `RESULT_STATUS` detail is
//!   retained for the reader.  A close that cannot prove both directions
//!   finished emits `RESET(CANCELLED)`, never a FIN, so truncation can never
//!   look like completion.
//! * Gate 4: the owner follows the record framing of what it sequenced and
//!   what it received (headers only, never payload), publishes its rotation
//!   freeze to the exchange tasks so their progress budgets pause, captures
//!   each HTTP stream's record position when it freezes for a scheduled
//!   rotation, and sends a scoped control `CANCEL` when a local
//!   `RESET(CANCELLED)` has to wait behind that freeze.
