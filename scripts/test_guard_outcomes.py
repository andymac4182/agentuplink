"""Tests for the shared guard-deletion outcome classifier.

The allowlist in `guard_outcomes.py` is the whole defence against the class of
defect recorded as M8-C06 and M8-C08: an outcome spelling nobody classified
used to vanish from every tally and let the run exit 0.  An allowlist can still
fail the same way if it quietly grows, so the three cases that matter are
pinned here.

#: Raised 8 -> 9 by gate 14 (`production_cluster::fs_rename_restart::`).  This
#: is the anti-vacuity floor for the anchoring scan -- what stops that rule
#: passing when it has matched *nothing* -- and not itself what covers gate 14,
#: since `every_module_filter_is_anchored` already inspects gate 14's filter
#: along with the rest.
EXPECTED_MODULE_FILTERS = 9

#: The floor each harness's `--check-anchors` must clear, so a run that
#: selected almost nothing cannot pass as a clean sweep.  Measured on
#: `m4c33-guard-preflight` off `154ac5d`: fs 427 anchors / 13 suites,
#: acp 148 / 7, m5 82 / 3, m3 5 / 2.  These are floors, not equalities --
#: adding a guard case must not break this file -- but a drop means either a
#: deleted case, which belongs in a task row, or a selection that stopped
#: selecting, which is the vacuity trap.
#:
#: **Re-measured on `m4c35-trename-restart`, and the fs floor had gone slack.**
#: The 427 above was already stale at `a8b30a1`, which really carries **431**
#: across 13 suites: four cases were added after that measurement without this
#: floor or the M4-06 row's roll-up following them.  A floor four short of the
#: truth still passes, which is exactly how it stops being a floor -- so it is
#: re-measured here rather than incremented, to what gate 14's tip actually
#: reports: **485 across 14 suites**.
#:
#: It was briefly set to 486 and this file caught it: gate 14 removed one
#: guard case after that reading, and the floor -- being an *at least* -- is
#: the one figure in this repository that fails loudly when it is set above
#: the truth rather than below it.  That is the whole point of it, and the
#: correction was taken by re-running `--check-anchors`, not by subtracting
#: one.
#:
#: **487** after task row M4-20 added two gate-4 cases (a `Twrite` refused
#: under a read-only grant is counted; it is counted by the grant, never by
#: its opcode), measured by `--check-anchors` on `feat-fs-demo`; **488**
#: after M4-21 added the gate-4 request-deadline case; **491** after M4-21's
#: review replaced it with four stall-bound cases, measured by
#: `--check-anchors`.

    `PINNED_WITNESS_DEBT` is the measured reach of M4-23: 691 of the 745 guard
    cases across the five harnesses were credited for a failure named after no
    test in the repository. It may go **down** as cases are given measured
    witnesses, and a rise fails this check.

    **What this does not check, stated because an earlier version of M4-23's
    row claimed it did (found on review).**  "May only shrink" holds. "A
    shrink means a witness was earned" does **not**. A case leaves the owed
    set by gaining a `WITNESSES` entry, but equally by being added to
    `EXPECT_GREEN`, by being given `expect_build_failure`, or by being
    deleted -- and this check cannot tell those apart. Measured: appending one
    name to `fs-guard-deletion`'s `EXPECT_GREEN` struck **five** cases at once,
    because that name recurs in five suites, and the only response was
    `the witness debt fell from 691 to 686`.

    The real protection is narrower and worth stating exactly. A **guessed**
    `WITNESSES` entry fails closed at the next full run: the named test does
    not redden, the case is classified `RED (wrong witness)`, and the run
    exits non-zero. Reclassifying to `EXPECT_GREEN` fails closed only if the
    guard is genuinely load-bearing, in which case the run reports
    `EXPECTED A DOCUMENTED GREEN, GOT: RED`. So a wrong witness is caught by
    running; a wrong exemption is caught only sometimes. The departure route

    **This replaces a fixture that tested the wrong scenario, and the

    barrier there refuse it. That is not what happened in the 76.8 s incident:
    there the dispatch was never reached at all, so no barrier inside it could
    fire. Driven against the then-current tree, the nested-dispatch bypass ran
    all **12** of `m3-guard-deletion`'s cases through the deletion loop with
    `read_only_entry` entered **zero** times and every shipped check passing.
    A barrier bolted onto a branch protects nothing when the branch is what
    was lost.

    So the property asserted here is the one that survives losing the
    dispatch: `--check-anchors` drops write capability at argument-parse time,
    so a harness that falls through to the deletion loop raises on its first
    mutation. The probe writes to a temporary file rather than a crate, so a
    regression fails this test instead of editing the product.

    **Defeating it.**  Remove the `forbid_writes_for_this_process()` call from
    a harness's `main()` and that harness fails here, having completed cases
    under a flag that must not edit anything. Removing the call from all six
    fails on the first.
